# Support
There are many different ways to get in touch with the fuge contributors or the community in general:

- For __issues__ or __questions__ open an [issue][] on Github.
- For __discussions__ we have a [Gitter][].

No matter how minor your issue is or how basic your question appears to be we want to hear it. We want you to get
up and running as quickly as possible so please, ask away.

## Contribute
[fuge][], [fuge.io][], and all official related repositories are __open__ projects and encourage participation. If you feel you can help in any way, be it with documentation, examples, extra testing, or new features, please be our guest.

## Helping out
Contributing is not always about adding new features. There are plenty of other ways to get involved. For instance:

- Add more tests, be they unit tests or performance-based tests.
- Write guides and documentation or proof-read and fix existing docs.
- Report, find or fix bugs, or all three.
- Add examples of usage, patterns or integration with other tools.

Like any other project, there is plenty to be done by people of all skill levels and specialities.
If you have any questions, or want to help out, please stop by our issues boards.

- For issues or questions on documentation, go to [fuge.io][org_issues].
- For issues or questions on fuge itself, go to [fuge][code_issues].
